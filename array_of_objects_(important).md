Absolutely, let's dive deeper into arrays of objects, the `map()` function to access object values, and the `filter()` function to remove elements from the array of objects.

### Array of Objects

An array of objects is a collection of objects stored within an array. Each object in the array can have multiple properties and methods.

**Example:**
```javascript
let students = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Alice', grade: 'A' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Bob', grade: 'B' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Charlie', grade: 'C' }
];
```

In this example, `students` is an array of objects where each object represents a student with properties like `id`, `name`, and `grade`.

### Using `map()` to Access Object Values

The `map()` method is used to transform each element of an array based on a callback function and returns a new array.

**Example using `map()` to get student names:**
```javascript
let studentNames = students.map(function(student) {
    return student.name;
});

console.log(studentNames); // Output: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
```

Here, `map()` is used to extract the `name` property from each student object and create a new array `studentNames` containing only the student names.

### Using `filter()` to Remove Elements from Array of Objects

The `filter()` method creates a new array with elements that pass a test implemented by a callback function.

**Example using `filter()` to remove students with grade 'B':**
```javascript
let filteredStudents = students.filter(function(student) {
    return student.grade !== 'B';
});

console.log(filteredStudents);
```

**Output:**
```javascript
[
    { id: 1, name: 'Alice', grade: 'A' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Charlie', grade: 'C' }
]
```

In this example, `filter()` is used to create a new array `filteredStudents` containing only those students who do not have a grade of 'B'.

Let's create an example where we have multiple students with different grades, and then we'll use the `filter()` method to filter and display data for each grade. We'll assume each grade has three students for simplicity.

```javascript
let students = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Alice', grade: 'A' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Bob', grade: 'A' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Charlie', grade: 'A' },
    { id: 4, name: 'David', grade: 'B' },
    { id: 5, name: 'Ella', grade: 'B' },
    { id: 6, name: 'Frank', grade: 'B' },
    { id: 7, name: 'Grace', grade: 'C' },
    { id: 8, name: 'Henry', grade: 'C' },
    { id: 9, name: 'Ivy', grade: 'C' }
];

// Filter and display students for each grade

// Grade A
let gradeAStudents = students.filter(function(student) {
    return student.grade === 'A';
});

console.log("Grade A Students:");
console.log(gradeAStudents);

// Grade B
let gradeBStudents = students.filter(function(student) {
    return student.grade === 'B';
});

console.log("\nGrade B Students:");
console.log(gradeBStudents);

// Grade C
let gradeCStudents = students.filter(function(student) {
    return student.grade === 'C';
});

console.log("\nGrade C Students:");
console.log(gradeCStudents);
```

In this example, we have an array `students` with nine student objects, three for each grade (A, B, and C). We then use the `filter()` method to filter out students for each grade and display the result for each grade separately.

When you run this code, you'll see the output showing students for each grade:

```
Grade A Students:
[
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', grade: 'A' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', grade: 'A' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Charlie', grade: 'A' }
]

Grade B Students:
[
  { id: 4, name: 'David', grade: 'B' },
  { id: 5, name: 'Ella', grade: 'B' },
  { id: 6, name: 'Frank', grade: 'B' }
]

Grade C Students:
[
  { id: 7, name: 'Grace', grade: 'C' },
  { id: 8, name: 'Henry', grade: 'C' },
  { id: 9, name: 'Ivy', grade: 'C' }
]
```

Each section of the output corresponds to the students in grade A, grade B, and grade C, respectively.
