# 10 questions to apply map in array

1. **Double the Numbers**
   - Given the array of numbers:
     ```javascript
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     ```
     How would you use the `.map()` method to create a new array where each number is doubled?

2. **Square the Numbers**
   - How can you use the `.map()` method to take an array of numbers:
     ```javascript
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     ```
     and produce a new array where each number is squared?

3. **Uppercase Strings**
   - Suppose you have an array of strings:
     ```javascript
     const strings = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
     ```
     Describe how you would use `.map()` to convert each string to uppercase.

4. **Extract Object Properties**
   - If you have an array of objects representing users:
     ```javascript
     const users = [
       { name: 'Alice', age: 30 },
       { name: 'Bob', age: 25 },
       { name: 'Charlie', age: 35 }
     ];
     ```
     How could you use `.map()` to create an array containing just the names?

5. **Calculate Areas**
   - Given an array of objects representing rectangles:
     ```javascript
     const rectangles = [
       { width: 5, height: 10 },
       { width: 8, height: 6 },
       { width: 3, height: 7 }
     ];
     ```
     Explain how `.map()` can be used to calculate and return an array of their areas.

6. **Convert Temperatures**
   - How would you use `.map()` to convert an array of temperatures in Celsius:
     ```javascript
     const celsiusTemps = [0, 25, 100];
     ```
     to Fahrenheit?

7. **Extract Unique IDs**
   - Suppose you have an array of objects with `id` properties:
     ```javascript
     const items = [
       { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
       { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' },
       { id: 1, name: 'Duplicate Item' }
     ];
     ```
     Explain how to use `.map()` along with other techniques to create an array of unique IDs.

8. **Filter and Map**
   - Describe how to combine `.filter()` and `.map()` to extract specific data from an array:
     ```javascript
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     ```
     and create a new array with squared even numbers.

9. **Calculate Grades**
   - Given an array of test scores:
     ```javascript
     const scores = [85, 92, 78, 65, 95];
     ```
     Explain how `.map()` can be used to convert each score to a letter grade based on a grading scale.

10. **Flatten Arrays**
    - If you have an array of arrays:
      ```javascript
      const nestedArray = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];
      ```
      How can you use `.map()` to flatten it into a single array?

These questions should give you a clearer understanding of how to use `.map()` in different scenarios, with the variable declarations and code snippets properly formatted. Let me know if you need further clarification!
